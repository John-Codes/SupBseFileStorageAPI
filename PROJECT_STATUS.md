# Supabase Audio File Storage API - Project Status

## Current State

This project provides a FastAPI-based API for CRUD operations on audio files using Supabase Storage. The API includes endpoints for uploading, listing, retrieving information about, downloading, and deleting audio files.

## Implementation Details

The API has been implemented with the following features:

1. **Health Check Endpoint** (`GET /`) - Verifies that the API is running
2. **File Upload Endpoint** (`POST /upload`) - Accepts audio files (MP3, WAV, FLAC, AAC, OGG, M4A) and stores them in Supabase Storage
3. **List Files Endpoint** (`GET /files`) - Retrieves a list of all uploaded audio files
4. **Get File Info Endpoint** (`GET /files/{file_id}`) - Retrieves detailed information about a specific audio file
5. **Download File Endpoint** (`GET /files/{file_id}/download`) - Downloads a specific audio file
6. **Delete File Endpoint** (`DELETE /files/{file_id}`) - Deletes a specific audio file

## Testing

A comprehensive test suite has been created using pytest that covers all endpoints:
- Health check endpoint tests
- File upload endpoint tests (valid files, invalid files, missing files)
- List files endpoint tests
- Get file info endpoint tests (existing files, non-existent files)
- Download file endpoint tests (existing files, non-existent files)
- Delete file endpoint tests (existing files, non-existent files)
- Cleanup procedures to remove test files after testing

## Known Issues

Due to compatibility issues with the Supabase Python client, some features may not work as expected. The API will still run and provide basic functionality, but file operations may fail with 500 Internal Server Errors.

## Required Manual Setup

Before running the API or tests, you MUST complete the following steps in your Supabase dashboard:

### 1. Create the Database Table

- Go to your Supabase project dashboard
- Navigate to Table Editor
- Click 'New Table'
- Name it 'audio_files'
- Add the following columns:
  - id (Text, Primary Key)
  - filename (Text)
  - content_type (Text)
  - size (Integer)
  - upload_timestamp (Timestamp)
  - storage_path (Text)
- Click 'Save'

### 2. Create the Storage Bucket

- Go to your Supabase project dashboard
- Navigate to Storage
- Click 'New bucket'
- Name it 'audio-files'
- Set it as public if you want public access to files
- Click 'Save'

### 3. Set up Row Level Security (RLS)

- Go to your Supabase project dashboard
- Navigate to Table Editor
- Click on the 'audio_files' table
- Click on 'RLS policies'
- Create policies for SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations as needed for your use case

## Running the API

1. Ensure you've completed the manual setup steps above
2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Verify your `.env` file contains your Supabase credentials:
   ```
   SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_key
   ```
4. Start the server:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
5. The API will be available at `http://localhost:8001`

## Running Tests

1. Ensure you've completed the manual setup steps above
2. Run the tests:
   ```
   pytest test_endpoints.py -v
   ```

## Next Steps

To improve this project, consider:
1. Implementing proper authentication and authorization
2. Adding better error handling and validation
3. Improving test coverage with more edge cases
4. Adding rate limiting to prevent abuse
5. Implementing pagination for the list files endpoint
6. Adding support for more audio file formats
7. Improving the Supabase client integration to resolve compatibility issues
